        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 free-range eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>125ml of milk</li>
            <li>1/2 stale baguette, cut on the diagonal into 2-3cm thick slices of 2 large thick slices of stale white
                bread cut into triangles</li>
            <li>Sunflower oil or butter, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To serve</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>Handful of berries such as blackberries, blueberries or quartered strawberries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the eggs, caster sugar, salt, cinnamon, vanilla and milk in a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Dip the pieces of bread into the egg mixture, coating both sides well. Allow the mixture to soak in a
                little, but not so much that the bread falls apart.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil or butter in a large frying pan.</li>
            <li>Lower the soaked bread into the pan using a fork. Fry for a couple of minutes on both sides, or until
                golden-brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a warm plate, cover and keep warm while you cook the remaining pieces of bread.</li>
            <li>Divide the French toast between two plates, drizzle over the honey and top with the berries.</li>
        </ol>
