        <h3>Courgette Pasta</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 chilli, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 courgettes, trimmmed and finely grated</li>
            <li>60g grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper seasoning</li>
            <li>400g of Rigatoni, cooked according to the packet instructions, drained (reserve a few spoonfuls of the
                cooking water)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the spinach balls, blanch the spinach leaves in a pan of salted, boiling water for 1-2 minutes, then
                drain well and refresh in cold water.</li>
            <li>Using your hands, squeeze out as much water from the blanched spinach leaves as possible, then finely
                chop the spinach.</li>
            <li>Transfer the blanched, drained spinach to a bowl, then stir in the beaten eggs, nutmeg, garlic pur√©e,
                breadcrumbs and parmesan. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well until the
                mixture binds together, adding more breadcrumbs or more water, as necessary, to bind the mixture.</li>
            <li>Roll the spinach mixture into walnut-sized balls and place onto a baking tray.</li>
            <li>Cover the base of a frying pan in a thin film of olive oil. Heat gently over a low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>When the oil is hot, add the spinach balls, in batches if necessary, and fry for 4-5 minutes on each
                side, or until crisp and golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside
                to drain on kitchen paper. Keep warm. Repeat the process with the remaining spinach balls.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, for the pasta sauce, heat the oil in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic
                and chilli and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.</li>
            <li>Add the courgettes and continue to fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the courgettes have started to soften.
            </li>
            <li>Add the parmesan and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix until well
                combined, then stir in the reserved cooking water from the pasta and the cooked, drained rigatoni.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide the pasta and sauce equally among four serving plates. Place the fried spinach balls on
                top.</li>
        </ol>
